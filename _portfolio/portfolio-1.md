title: "3D City Index"
excerpt: "3D city models are omnipresent in urban management and simulations. We establish a holistic and comprehensive 4-category framework – ‘3D City Index’, encompassing 47 criteria to identify key properties of 3D city models, enabling their assessment and benchmarking, and suggesting usability. The framework implementation enables a comprehensive and structured understanding of the landscape of semantic 3D geospatial data, as well as doubles as an evaluated collection of open 3D city models.
